# Dog-Breed-Prediction-with-GUI
Using Keras and Tensorflow to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image This is a supervised learning problem,specifically a multiclass classification problem.
**Steps to solve the problem**<br>
1)loading the data from kaggle<br>
2)load labels csv for labels that contain image ID and breed.<br>
3)checking the breed count<br>
4)One hot encoding on labels data prediction column<br>
5)Load the images,convert them in an array and normalize them.<br>
6)Checked the shape and size of the x and y data.<br>
7)building the model network architecture .<br>
8)Split the data and fit it into the model and create an accuracy plot<br>
9)Evaluate the model accuracy score<br>
10)predict
